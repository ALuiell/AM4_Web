      <h1>Ryzen 3000 series</h1>
      <p class="size-text">he Ryzen 3000 series was a major update to the Ryzen architecture, and it delivered
        significant improvements in performance, efficiency, and features. The processors were based on the new Zen 2
        architecture, which was designed to be more efficient and to offer higher clock speeds. The Ryzen 3000 series
        processors also supported a variety of new features, including PCIe 4.0 lanes, AMD's Precision Boost 2
        technology, and AMD's StoreMI technology.

        The Ryzen 3000 series was available in a variety of configurations, with up to 16 cores and 32 threads. The
        processors also supported a variety of features, including DDR4-3200 memory, PCIe 4.0 lanes, and AMD's SenseMI
        technology.

        The Ryzen 3000 series was a critical and commercial success for AMD. The processors were praised for their
        performance, efficiency, and value. The Ryzen 3000 series helped AMD to further regain market share from Intel,
        and it paved the way for the success of the Ryzen 4000 series and Ryzen 5000 series processors.</p>
