      <h1>AM4 Socket History</h1>
      <p class="size-text"><img src="images/socket am4.jpg" alt="motherboard with am4 socket" class="right-img">The AM4
        socket, developed by AMD, is a processor socket for microprocessors built on the Zen architecture (Ryzen brand)
        and subsequent. Introduced in 2016. The socket is PGA type and has 1331 contacts.

        AM4 became the first AMD socket for motherboards with support for the DDR4 memory standard and a single socket
        for both high-performance processors without an integrated graphics core (similar to Socket AM3+), as well as
        for budget processors and APUs (previously used different sockets of the AM / FM series).

        Development of AM4 began in 2015, after the release of the first-generation Ryzen processors. AMD aimed to
        create a socket that would support both current and future Ryzen processors, as well as processors from other
        manufacturers built on the Zen architecture.

        AM4 was officially introduced in 2016 along with the release of the second-generation Ryzen processors. The
        socket received positive reviews from critics and users. It was noted for its flexibility, upgradability, and
        support for new technologies such as DDR4 and PCIe 3.0.

        In 2017, AMD released the third-generation Ryzen processors, which also support AM4. In 2018, the company
        released the fourth-generation Ryzen processors, which also support AM4.

        In 2020, AMD released the fifth-generation Ryzen processors, which also support AM4. In 2022, the company
        released the sixth-generation Ryzen processors, which also support AM4.

        AM4 is one of the most popular processor sockets on the market. It is used in a wide range of motherboards from
        various manufacturers.</p>
